## Current Sprint: Fix Runtime Error

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUE - BLOCKING
**Runtime Error**: `Property 'require' doesn't exist` in Hermes JavaScript engine

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Node.js utility scripts (`assets/convert-icons.js`) are being bundled with React Native app
- TypeScript compiler files (`lib/` directory) are included in the bundle
- CommonJS `require` statements not supported in React Native with Hermes engine

#### Impact
- App crashes immediately on startup
- Users cannot access any functionality
- Development blocked until resolved

### üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

#### Task 1: Remove Node.js Utilities from Bundle
- [x] Move `assets/convert-icons.js` to `scripts/` directory
- [x] Update `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts
- [x] Ensure `lib/` directory is not bundled
- [x] Test app launch after changes

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Status**: üî¥ NOT STARTED

#### Task 2: Verify Bundle Configuration
- [x] Check Metro bundler configuration
- [x] Verify Babel configuration excludes Node.js files
- [x] Test bundle generation
- [x] Confirm no `require` statements in final bundle

**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes
**Status**: üî¥ NOT STARTED

#### Task 3: Test App Launch
- [x] Launch app in development mode
- [x] Verify no runtime errors
- [x] Test basic navigation flow
- [x] Fix authentication error (AuthSessionMissingError)
- [x] Investigate authentication stuck issue (enhanced logging added)

#### Task 4: Fix Asset and Import Issues
- [x] Fix missing icon.png references in app.json
- [x] Update asset paths to use SVG files
- [x] Resolve linking import resolution issue
- [x] Test app launch with clean cache

**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes
**Status**: üî¥ NOT STARTED
